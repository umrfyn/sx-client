This project implements the custom Discord UDP protocol for sending media. Since Discord is likely change their custom protocol, this library is subject to break at any point. An effort will be made to keep this library up to date with the latest Discord protocol, but it is not guranteed.

For better stability it is recommended to use WebRTC protocol instead since Discord is forced to adhere to spec, which means that the non-signaling portion of the code is guaranteed to work.

## Features

- Playing video & audio in a voice channel (`Go Live`, or webcam video)

## Implementation

What I implemented and what I did not.

### Video codecs

- [X] VP8
- [ ] VP9
- [X] H.264
- [X] H.265
- [ ] AV1

### Packet types

- [X] RTP (sending of realtime data)
- [ ] RTX (retransmission)

### Connection types

- [X] Regular Voice Connection
- [X] Go live

### Encryption

- [X] Transport Encryption
- [ ] [End-to-end Encryption](https://github.com/dank074/Discord-video-stream/issues/102)

### Extras

- [X] Figure out rtp header extensions (discord specific) (discord seems to use one-byte RTP header extension https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8285.html#section-4.2)

Extensions supported by Discord (taken from the webrtc sdp exchange)

## Requirements

For full functionality, this library requires an FFmpeg build with `libzmq` enabled. Here is our recommendation:
- Windows & Linux: [BtbN's FFmpeg Builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds)
- macOS (Intel): [evermeet.cx](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/)
- macOS (Apple Silicon): Install from Homebrew

## Usage

Install the package, alongside its peer-dependency discord.js-selfbot-v13:

```
npm install @dank074/discord-video-stream@latest
npm install discord.js-selfbot-v13@latest
```

Create a new Streamer, and pass it a selfbot Client

```typescript
import { Client } from "discord.js-selfbot-v13";
import { Streamer } from '@dank074/discord-video-stream';

const streamer = new Streamer(new Client());
await streamer.client.login('TOKEN HERE');

```

Make client join a voice channel

```typescript
await streamer.joinVoice("GUILD ID HERE", "CHANNEL ID HERE");
```

Start sending media

```typescript
import { prepareStream, playStream, Utils } from "@dank074/discord-video-stream"
try {
    const { command, output } = prepareStream("DIRECT VIDEO URL OR READABLE STREAM HERE", {
        // Specify either width or height for aspect ratio aware scaling
        // Specify both for stretched output
        height: 1080,

        // Force frame rate, or leave blank to use source frame rate
        frameRate: 30,
        bitrateVideo: 5000,
        bitrateVideoMax: 7500,
        videoCodec: Utils.normalizeVideoCodec("H264" /* or H265, VP9 */),
        h26xPreset: "veryfast" // or superfast, ultrafast, ...
    });
    command.on("error", (err, stdout, stderr) => {
        // Handle ffmpeg errors here
    });

    await playStream(output, streamer, {
        type: "go-live" // use "camera" for camera stream
    });

    console.log("Finished playing video");
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
}
```

## Encoder options available

```typescript
/**

 * options have no effects
 * 
 * Only use this if your video stream is Discord streaming friendly, otherwise
 * you'll get a glitchy output
 */
noTranscoding?: boolean;
/**
 * Video output width
 */
width?: number;
/**

## `playStream` options available

```typescript
/**
 * Set stream type as "Go Live" or camera stream
 */
type?: "go-live" | "camera",

/**
 * Override video width sent to Discord.
 * 
 * DO NOT SPECIFY UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
 */
width?: number,

/**
 * Override video height sent to Discord.
 * 
 * DO NOT SPECIFY UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
 */

 * 
 * See https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#:~:text=%2Dreadrate_initial_burst
 */
readrateInitialBurst?: number,
```

## Streamer options available

These control internal operations of the library, and can be changed through the `opts` property on the `Streamer` class. You probably shouldn't change it without a good reason

```typescript
/**
 * Enables sending RTCP sender reports. Helps the receiver synchronize the
 * audio/video frames, except in some weird cases which is why you can disable it
 */
rtcpSenderReportEnabled?: boolean;
/**
 * ChaCha20-Poly1305 Encryption is faster than AES-256-GCM, except when using AES-NI
 */
forceChacha20Encryption?: boolean;
```

## Performance tips

See [this page](./PERFORMANCE.md) for some tips on improving performance

## Running example

`examples/basic/src/config.json`:

```json
"token": "SELF TOKEN HERE",
"acceptedAuthors": ["USER_ID_HERE"],
```

1. Configure your `config.json` with your accepted authors ids, and your self token
2. Generate js files with ```npm run build```
3. Start program with: ```npm run start```
4. Join a voice channel
5. Start streaming with commands:

for go-live

```
$play-live <Direct video link>
```

or for cam

```
$play-cam <Direct video link>
```

for example:

```
$play-live http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4
```

## FAQS

- Can I stream on existing voice connection (CAM) and in a go-live connection simultaneously?

Yes, just send the media packets over both udp connections. The voice gateway expects you to signal when a user turns on their camera, so make sure you signal using `client.signalVideo(guildId, channelId, true)` before you start sending cam media packets.

- Does this library work with bot tokens?

No, Discord blocks video from bots which is why this library uses a selfbot library as peer dependency. You must use a user token
